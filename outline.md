# Outline

## Preface

Plan: alternate narrative chapters with technical chapters.  Read odd-numbered for a continuous narrative, even-numbered to play along.

## Introduction

"Scholarship"in antiquity?

Dickey vs. Matthaios, Montanari, Rengakos

Pfeiffer "scholars" vs "scientists"

Dickey says, look at genre (form of writing)

Result is "scholarly" works not concerned with the literary questions of the "scholars".  What's going on?

Extend the principle: in addition to common generic forms of text, look at


- common habits/features/structures of language
- common instruments
- common modes of thought

I this talk, focus on one instrument: the κανών



Rigid separation is anachronistic.  Many possible ways to approach this.  Chapter 1 looks at a feature of language in Strabo.  Following cases look at a shared practice:  use of the table (κανών) to implement what in 2016 we would call apps.

## 1. Strabo really wants to be a scholar, not a poet

Cf. use of vadj in scholia to *Iliad*

## 2. Evaluating significance of vadj in Strabo and scholia
